    description: "For Everclear's rebrand from Connext, I led the repositioning from a B2C to B2B focus, coupled with a token migration introducing new utility. Our approach ensured a sequential rollout: communicating changes in order, their impact on users and the project, and the sunsetting of the old offering. When the initial tagline fell short, I revisited it from first principles—emphasizing our shift from competing with projects to supporting them—and proposed \"The Backbone of Bridging,\" a self-explanatory alternative to vague phrases like \"the first clearing layer.\""

    description: "To promote Everclear's new token staking feature, we targeted a native Web3 audience familiar with similar protocols, clearly communicating the project's value, token mechanics, and incentives through a partnership with ad company Slise. I leveraged Dune Analytics to identify and segment users of comparable staking protocols. Collaborating with a graphic designer, I developed concept drafts for visuals and conducted A/B testing within the live ad campaign—including variants featuring an ad for a crosschain analytics dashboard that I helped design—achieving a 0.45% CTR that resulted in a 3.8% increase in protocol staking."

    description: "Previously, content creation felt reactive, often resulting in filler posts due to a lack of structured ideas. To address this, I established a comprehensive content calendar, ensuring a consistent flow of high-quality topics across categories like educational content, thought leadership, partnerships, and community engagement. I also revamped post formatting for greater appeal—making them concise, readable, and engaging—while providing concept graphics to guide the designer and emphasizing high-quality, appropriate replies to user interactions. By directing this content marketing campaign, I elevated key engagement KPIs by 204% within three months."

    description: "I led a network of community leaders to scale Everclear's Telegram communities, developing methodologies to assist them in identifying and engaging with relevant posts on the Everclear Intern X account. Through trial-and-error experimentation, we refined the account's voice to ensure it offered unique value—targeting a distinct audience from the main Everclear X account, which had previously led to overlap. This was achieved via digestible educational content, timely updates, and engaging memes. I also guided leaders in navigating discussions with protocol leads to resolve customer issues effectively."

This included collaborating with Arbitrum's marketing team on joint initiatives. For the $10 million Near Foundation raise, I developed a concise narrative for X and Web3 outlets like CoinDesk, Business Insider, and CoinMarketCap. Simultaneously, I directed co-marketing with various chains and protocols to boost reach, while overseeing livestream styles—curating questions, flow, and topics for new partners."
