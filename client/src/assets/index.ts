// Export all assets from this file with static paths instead of imports
// This avoids the Vite import issues and runtime errors

// Export videos with direct paths to public folder
export const videos = {
  // All timeline videos have been replaced with the optimized Spyro video
};

// Export any other assets below
export const images = {
  // Add image paths here when needed
};
