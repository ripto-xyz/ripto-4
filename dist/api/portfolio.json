    "description": "For Everclear's rebrand from Connext, I led the repositioning from a B2C to B2B focus, coupled with a token migration introducing new utility. Our approach ensured a sequential rollout: communicating changes in order, their impact on users and the project, and the sunsetting of the old offering. When the initial tagline fell short, I revisited it from first principles—emphasizing our shift from competing with projects to supporting them—and proposed \"The Backbone of Bridging,\" a self-explanatory alternative to vague phrases like \"the first clearing layer.\"",
