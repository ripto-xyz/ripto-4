    "description": "For Everclear's rebrand from Connext, I led the repositioning from a B2C to B2B focus, coupled with a token migration introducing new utility. Our approach ensured a sequential rollout: communicating changes in order, their impact on users and the project, and the sunsetting of the old offering. When the initial tagline fell short, I revisited it from first principles—emphasizing our shift from competing with projects to supporting them—and proposed \"The Backbone of Bridging,\" a self-explanatory alternative to vague phrases like \"the first clearing layer.\"",

I leveraged Dune Analytics to identify and segment users of comparable staking protocols. Collaborating with a graphic designer, I developed concept drafts for visuals and conducted A/B testing within the live ad campaign—including variants featuring an ad for a crosschain analytics dashboard that I helped design—achieving a 0.45% CTR that resulted in a 3.8% increase in protocol staking.",

To address this, I established a comprehensive content calendar, ensuring a consistent flow of high-quality topics across categories like educational content, thought leadership, partnerships, and community engagement.
