Our approach ensured a sequential rollout: communicating changes in order, their impact on users and the project, and the sunsetting of the old offering. When the initial tagline fell short, I revisited it from first principles—emphasizing our shift from competing with projects to supporting them—and proposed \"The Backbone of Bridging,\" a self-explanatory alternative to vague phrases like \"the first clearing layer.\"","challenge":"Redefine brand positioning in a competitive Web3 landscape while maintaining core values and community trust during transition.","solution":"Developed a multi-phase rebranding strategy with market research, competitive analysis, and community-driven messaging framework.","results":"Successfully repositioned brand with 40% increase in market awareness, 60% growth in community engagement, and improved brand perception scores.","testimonial":{"text":"Laurence's rebranding strategy transformed our market position.

I leveraged Dune Analytics to identify and segment users of comparable staking protocols. Collaborating with a graphic designer, I developed concept drafts for visuals and conducted A/B testing within the live ad campaign—including variants featuring an ad for a crosschain analytics dashboard that I helped design—achieving a 0.45% CTR that resulted in a 3.8% increase in protocol staking.","challenge":"Navigate Web3 advertising restrictions while reaching crypto-native audiences through authentic, non-intrusive ad experiences.","solution":"Created native advertising campaigns across Web3 media, DeFi platforms, and crypto communities with performance tracking.","results":"Achieved 3.2x ROAS across Web3 channels, 45% lower CPA than traditional advertising, and 25% higher engagement rates.","testimonial":{"text":"The Web3 advertising approach was game-changing.
